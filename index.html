                <h3>TTC Traffic Collisions and Subway Delay Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    In this analysis, I investigated whether traffic collisions in Toronto correlate with subway delays on the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) network. 
                    By cleaning and preparing data in SQL, then creating interactive visuals in Tableau, I sought to uncover any meaningful link 
                    between surface-level traffic collisions and underground subway disruptions.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Collection & Cleaning:</strong> Imported collision records and TTC delay logs, using SQL to filter out incomplete data, 
                        remove duplicates, and standardize date/time formats for accurate comparison.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Grouped collision counts by hour and month, while examining average subway delay durations 
                        during the same periods. Calculated correlation coefficients to gauge the relationship between collisions and delays.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Built interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize hourly/monthly trends and identify 
                        potential overlap between traffic collisions and subway delays.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Key Findings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Distinct Rush-Hour Patterns:</strong> Traffic collisions peaked during traditional rush hours (8 AM, 5 PM), 
                        but subway delays spiked at 6 AM and 10 PM, suggesting different driving factors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>No Strong Correlation:</strong> Monthly and hourly analyses showed minimal alignment between collision numbers and subway delays.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Operational Influences on Delays:</strong> Maintenance and equipment issues appeared more responsible for delays 
                        than external traffic conditions, particularly during off-peak hours.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Figure 4 -->

                    <img src="images/figure4.png" alt="A line chart comparing hourly collisions and subway delays, revealing distinct peak times.">
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Illustrate and compare the frequency of traffic collisions against subway delay occurrences on an hourly basis.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Collisions peak around rush hours (8 AM and 5 PM).</li>
                            <li>Subway delays peak at 6 AM and 10 PM, outside typical rush-hour windows.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> The divergence in peak times underscores the limited influence of rush-hour collisions on subway disruptions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Additional Detail:</em> The line chart aggregates total collisions and delay counts by hour, allowing a direct visual 
                        comparison of trends throughout a 24-hour period.
                    </p>

                    <img src="images/figure5.png" alt="A bar chart showing average subway delay times across different hours of the day.">
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Highlight the hours with the longest average subway delay durations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Average delays are highest early in the morning (around 6 AM) and late in the evening (around 10 PM).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> 
                        Off-peak hours may be prone to longer delays due to planned maintenance, fewer staff on duty, or scheduled operational tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Additional Detail:</em> The data is aggregated by hour and averaged to reveal when commuters might experience the greatest delays, 
                        guiding resource allocation.

                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Examine whether monthly fluctuations in collision frequency mirror subway delay trends.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Months with high collision counts do not necessarily see a spike in subway delays.</li>
                            <li>Seasonal variation in traffic accidents does not translate directly to subway service disruptions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Seasonal factors affecting road safety (e.g., winter conditions) do not appear to consistently impact underground rail service.</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Additional Detail:</em> This view helps identify potential seasonal or weather-related factors. 
                        While collisions may follow certain monthly patterns, they do not align with subway performance issues over the same timeframe.

                    <p><strong>Purpose of the Visualization:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide an hourly analysis of traffic collision frequency (rectangle size) and average subway delays (color intensity).</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Rectangle Size:</strong> Represents the total number of collisions in that hour (larger rectangles = more collisions).</li>
                        <li><strong>Color Intensity:</strong> Indicates the average delay duration (in minutes) for subway services. 
                            Darker colors = longer delays.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Key Observations:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Collision Frequency (Rectangle Size):</strong> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hours like <strong>15:00</strong> (3 PM) and <strong>14:00</strong> (2 PM) stand out as larger rectangles, reflecting higher collision counts.</li>
                                <li>These timeframes align with peak traffic volume or the tail end of rush-hour congestion.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Average Delay Duration (Color Intensity):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Darker rectangles (e.g., <strong>5:00 AM</strong> and <strong>7:00 AM</strong>) signify longer subway delays, 
                                    even when collisions are relatively low at those hours.</li>
                                <li>Many high-collision hours (e.g., <strong>15:00</strong> and <strong>14:00</strong>) are lighter in color, indicating shorter delays.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Overlap of High Collisions & Long Delays:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Few hours show both large size (high collisions) and dark color (long delays), reinforcing a weak correlation between the two factors.</li>
                                <li>For example, <strong>5:00 AM</strong> has dark shading (long delays) but small size (low collision frequency), suggesting operational issues over external factors.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Off-Peak Hours:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hours such as <strong>0:00</strong> (midnight), <strong>3:00 AM</strong>, and <strong>4:00 AM</strong> show small rectangles (few collisions) and lighter shading (short delays).</li>
                                <li>This indicates minimal traffic activity and relatively efficient subway service in late-night periods.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Insights & Conclusions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Weak Correlation:</strong> The lack of overlap between large rectangles (high collision frequency) and dark colors (long subway delays) 
                            confirms that external traffic collisions are not a major driver of subway disruptions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Operational Factors Dominate:</strong> High delays in early morning or late evening hours underscore maintenance schedules, 
                            equipment checks, or staffing levels as leading causes of service interruptions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Focus on Off-Peak Interventions:</strong> The TTC could reduce delays by improving operational efficiency during hours when 
                            collisions are low but delays remain high (e.g., 5:00 AM, 10:00 PM).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h4>Tools Used</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SQL:</strong> Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tableau:</strong> Data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Conclusion:</strong> While traffic collisions are a notable urban concern, this analysis shows they have minimal direct impact on subway 
                    delays. Instead, addressing internal operational factors—such as maintenance schedules and equipment reliability—can significantly enhance TTC’s service efficiency.

                <h3>Google Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone, I focused on <em>Cyclistic</em>, a bike-share service in Chicago seeking to understand 
                    the differences in riding behavior between casual users and annual members. My goal was to identify strategies that could 
                    turn occasional riders into loyal subscribers, thereby boosting long-term revenue and user engagement.
                </p>

                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Consolidated multiple CSV files in Excel, removed duplicates, and standardized columns (e.g., ride IDs, timestamps) for consistency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis:</strong> Calculated average ride lengths, weekday/weekend usage frequencies, and monthly trends. Identified how seasonal factors influence ride volumes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualization & Reporting:</strong> Built Tableau dashboards to compare casual vs. member ride lengths, usage distribution by day of the week, and seasonal patterns.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Key Findings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Longer, Leisure-Oriented Rides for Casual Users:</strong> Average ride length is ~24.65 minutes, 
                        almost double that of members (~12.67 minutes).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Weekend & Seasonal Surges:</strong> Casual riders show higher activity on weekends, especially during warmer months, while members maintain consistent weekday usage.

                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Contrast how each user type spreads their ridership across days of the week.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Casual riders’ usage spikes on weekends, implying leisure and tourism-driven behavior.</li>
                            <li>Members show consistent weekday patterns, aligning with routine commutes or daily errands.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> 
                        Weekend-oriented promotions might appeal to casual riders, while commuter benefits and convenience features resonate with members.

                <h4>Tools Used</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Excel:</strong> Data cleaning, preliminary exploration, and pivot tables.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tableau:</strong> Dashboard creation for ride length comparison, seasonality trends, and usage patterns by day of week.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Targeted marketing campaigns during peak leisure periods (weekends and summer) could encourage casual riders to 
                    become annual members. Emphasizing membership perks—like unlimited rides, discounted rates, and priority service—would address the distinct 
                    needs of this recreational user base and potentially boost long-term retention.
