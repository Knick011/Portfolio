            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I’m <strong>Nihith Mekala</strong>, a dedicated Data Analyst with a knack for uncovering stories hidden within data. 
                I specialize in <em>SQL, Excel, and Tableau</em> to transform raw numbers into meaningful insights that guide strategic decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey has been shaped by diverse experiences in life sciences, marketing, and event management. 
                This unique blend allows me to approach analytics with both a scientific and creative lens. Whether I’m examining 
                trends in Toronto’s public transportation or strategizing ways to boost user engagement, 
                I’ve learned that the power of data is amplified when effectively communicated.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my tenure at McMaster University, I honed my analytical thinking while also sharpening my ability to present 
                data-driven insights in an understandable and impactful way. From mentoring international students and coordinating cultural events, 
                to launching a successful charity initiative, I witnessed how data can unite communities, optimize operations, and spark positive change.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of data crunching, I enjoy exploring languages and cultures—I'm fluent in English, Telugu, and Hindi, 
                with a basic understanding of Tamil, Japanese, and Turkish. This global perspective helps me collaborate effectively 
                with diverse teams and audiences. When I’m not buried in datasets, you’ll find me brainstorming innovative solutions to business challenges.

                <h3>Financial Analysis: Meme Stocks vs. WMT, GOLD, and USD</h3>
                <p>
                    Below is my most recent project, examining the volatile world of meme stocks like AMC, GME, and MSTR, 
                    contrasted against more established assets (WMT, GOLD, and USD). This analysis illustrates how 
                    <em>simplistic visualizations (as seen in the first two charts)</em> can mislead investors, whereas 
                    <em>detailed, contextualized figures</em> (the subsequent charts) provide clearer insights and more accurate conclusions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The initial charts—<strong>Comparison of Meme Stocks and WMT</strong> and <strong>Average Price of Meme Stocks vs. Gold and USD</strong>—show how 
                    oversimplified or incomplete presentations can lead us to wrong assumptions. In contrast, 
                    the later figures illustrate best practices in financial analysis and data storytelling, covering monthly averages, 
                    investment metrics, outperformance, and volatility comparisons.
                </p>

                         alt="A line graph tracking AMC, GME, MSTR, and WMT from early 2020 to 2025, showing notable volatility in meme stocks versus WMT.">
                    <p><strong>Comparison of Meme Stocks and WMT</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong>  
                        This line graph tracks the price trends of AMC, GME, MSTR (MicroStrategy), and WMT (Walmart) from early 2020 to 2025. 
                        Meme stocks like AMC and GME show extreme volatility, particularly during the 2021 meme stock rally. In contrast, 
                        WMT reflects a stable, blue-chip trajectory.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Key Peaks:</em> GME spiked dramatically in early 2021, driven by a retail trading frenzy (e.g., Reddit’s WallStreetBets). 
                            AMC followed a similar, albeit less intense, pattern. MSTR’s performance often correlates with Bitcoin investments.</li>
                        <li><em>WMT’s Stability:</em> Walmart exhibits gradual upward movement, emphasizing its role as a fundamentally driven stock.</li>
                        <li><em>General Trends:</em> Meme stocks often lost much of their value post-peak, highlighting high risk-reward cycles.
                            WMT’s resilience appeals to long-term, risk-averse investors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add annotations for key events (e.g., GME short squeeze in January 2021).</li>
                        <li>Consider a secondary Y-axis so WMT’s relatively smaller changes remain visible.</li>
                        <li>Apply color coding or shading to highlight periods of extreme volatility.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Average Price of Meme Stocks vs. Gold and USD</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong>
                        This bar chart displays the average prices of AMC, GME, MSTR, WMT, Gold, and USD over the observed period.
                        Gold ($1,944.59) stands out with a consistently high value, while meme stocks and WMT appear much lower.
                        USD remains around $1.04.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Gold’s Role:</em> Gold’s high average price reflects its status as a safe-haven asset, maintaining strong demand during economic uncertainty.</li>
                        <li><em>Meme Stocks vs. WMT:</em> AMC, GME, and MSTR show higher averages than WMT due to sharp meme-fueled spikes. 
                            WMT’s lower but steadier trend offers reliability for investors.</li>
                        <li><em>USD:</em> The chart shows the dollar’s value is relatively stable over time, underlining its role as a global reserve currency.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Normalize data as percentage returns instead of raw prices to make cross-asset comparisons more meaningful.</li>
                        <li>Include standard deviation or error bars to highlight each asset’s volatility.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                        This line graph tracks monthly average prices for the same assets, revealing broader trends over time. Gold maintains a relatively stable upward path, 
                        while meme stocks show drastic shifts coinciding with retail trading hype.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Meme Stock Volatility:</em> GME and AMC soared in early 2021, then declined steeply as retail enthusiasm cooled. 
                            MSTR’s price moves correlate strongly with Bitcoin sentiments.</li>
                        <li><em>Gold and USD:</em> Gold remains steady with slight upward momentum, while USD shows no distinct trend as it serves primarily as a currency measure.</li>
                        <li><em>WMT’s Performance:</em> Walmart exhibits slow but steady growth, a hallmark of a mature, stable company.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Annotate specific months (e.g., GME’s surge in January 2021) for clarity.</li>
                        <li>Use a logarithmic scale to compare assets with vastly different price ranges.</li>
                        <li>Offer interactive toggles so viewers can isolate individual stock trends without clutter.</li>

                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>GME’s Surge:</em> The early 2021 short squeeze propelled GME to extraordinary returns, eventually reverting to more typical levels.</li>
                        <li><em>Steady Performers:</em> WMT and Gold deliver modest yet consistent growth, appealing to investors valuing stability over speculation.</li>
                        <li><em>AMC and MSTR:</em> Although they experience periodic spikes, both ultimately underperform WMT and Gold on a risk-adjusted basis.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong></p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Include additional comparison metrics (e.g., cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio) for deeper investor insights.</li>

                        <li><em>GME and MSTR:</em> GME’s figure (~87%) and MSTR (~83%) highlight how extreme spikes can overshadow a stable stock like WMT,

                        <li><em>Meme Stocks:</em> Again demonstrate low alignment with USD, reinforcing the notion that their price movements

                    By comparing simpler visuals to more comprehensive analyses, we see how critical in-depth data visualization 
                    and context can be. The final figures—highlighting monthly behavior, returns per dollar, and volatility—offer a 
                    far more accurate understanding of risk and performance than a basic average price or raw line chart.

                    Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) network. By cleaning and preparing data in SQL, then creating interactive 
                    visuals in Tableau, I sought to uncover any meaningful link between surface-level traffic collisions and 
                    underground subway disruptions.

                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Collection & Cleaning:</strong> Imported collision records and TTC delay logs, using SQL to filter out incomplete data, 
                        remove duplicates, and standardize date/time formats for accurate comparison.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Grouped collision counts by hour and month, while examining average subway delay durations 
                        during the same periods. Calculated correlation coefficients to gauge the relationship between collisions and delays.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Built interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize hourly/monthly trends and identify 
                        potential overlap between traffic collisions and subway delays.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Key Findings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Distinct Rush-Hour Patterns:</strong> Traffic collisions peaked during traditional rush hours (8 AM, 5 PM), 
                        but subway delays spiked at 6 AM and 10 PM, suggesting different driving factors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>No Strong Correlation:</strong> Monthly and hourly analyses showed minimal alignment between collision numbers and subway delays.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Operational Influences on Delays:</strong> Maintenance and equipment issues appeared more responsible for delays 
                        than external traffic conditions, particularly during off-peak hours.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                            <li>Collisions peak around rush hours (8 AM and 5 PM).</li>
                            <li>Subway delays peak at 6 AM and 10 PM, outside typical rush-hour windows.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> The divergence in peak times underscores the limited influence of rush-hour collisions on subway disruptions.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Hours like 15:00 (3 PM) and 14:00 (2 PM) are larger, reflecting higher collision counts.</li>
                                <li>These align with daytime rush or immediate post-rush periods.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Few hours show both large size (high collisions) and dark color (long delays), implying weak correlation.</li>
                                <li>5:00 AM has dark shading (long delays) but small size (low collisions), pointing to operational issues over external factors.</li>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Insights & Conclusions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Weak Correlation:</strong> Large rectangles (high collisions) rarely overlap with dark colors (long delays), suggesting collisions do not majorly drive subway disruptions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Operational Factors:</strong> Maintenance or equipment checks at early mornings or late evenings appear to be key delay drivers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Focus on Off-Peak Interventions:</strong> The TTC could reduce delays by improving operational efficiency during hours with lower collision rates but higher delay durations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h4>Tools Used</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SQL:</strong> Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tableau:</strong> Data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Conclusion:</strong> While traffic collisions are a notable urban concern, this analysis shows they have minimal direct impact on subway 
                    delays. Instead, addressing internal operational factors—such as maintenance schedules and equipment reliability—can significantly enhance TTC’s service efficiency.

                <h3>Google Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone, I focused on <em>Cyclistic</em>, a bike-share service in Chicago seeking to understand 
                    the differences in riding behavior between casual users and annual members. My goal was to identify strategies that could 
                    turn occasional riders into loyal subscribers, thereby boosting long-term revenue and user engagement.
                </p>

                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Consolidated multiple CSV files in Excel, removed duplicates, and standardized columns (e.g., ride IDs, timestamps) for consistency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis:</strong> Calculated average ride lengths, weekday/weekend usage frequencies, and monthly trends. Identified how seasonal factors influence ride volumes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualization & Reporting:</strong> Built Tableau dashboards to compare casual vs. member ride lengths, usage distribution by day of the week, and seasonal patterns.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Key Findings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Longer, Leisure-Oriented Rides for Casual Users:</strong> Average ride length is ~24.65 minutes, 
                        almost double that of members (~12.67 minutes).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Weekend & Seasonal Surges:</strong> Casual riders show higher activity on weekends, especially during warmer months, while members maintain consistent weekday usage.
