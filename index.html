                <h3>TTC Traffic Collisions and Subway Delay Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    In this analysis, I investigated whether traffic collisions in Toronto correlate with subway delays on the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) network. 
                    By cleaning and preparing data in SQL, and creating interactive visuals in Tableau, I sought to identify any meaningful connections 
                    between surface-level traffic collisions and underground subway disruptions.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Collection & Cleaning:</strong> Imported collision records and TTC delay logs, then used SQL to filter out incomplete data, remove duplicates, and standardize date/time formats.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Calculated collision frequencies by hour and month, while examining average subway delay durations during the same periods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Developed Tableau dashboards to visualize trends and identify peak occurrences of collisions and delays.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Key Findings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Distinct Rush-Hour Patterns:</strong> Traffic collisions peaked at 8 AM and 5 PM—typical rush hours—while 
                        subway delays spiked at 6 AM and 10 PM, suggesting different causal factors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>No Strong Correlation:</strong> Despite assumptions, monthly and hourly analyses revealed minimal connection 
                        between collision numbers and subway delays.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Internal Operational Influence:</strong> Analysis indicates that maintenance and equipment issues might be a larger contributor to delays than external traffic conditions.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Figure 4 -->

                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Highlight potential overlap between collision frequency and subway delay counts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong> Collisions peak during rush hours, delays peak outside those hours.</p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Reinforces the idea that collisions are not a primary driver of subway delays.</p>
                </div>

                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Display time periods with the longest subway delays.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong> Early mornings (6 AM) and late evenings (10 PM) see higher average delays.</p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Operational activities (e.g., maintenance) likely happen during off-peak hours, contributing to increased delays at those times.</p>
                </div>

                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Determine if seasonal or monthly changes in collisions affect delays.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong> Monthly collision trends do not align with subway delay trends.</p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Traffic patterns have limited direct impact on transit service disruptions.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Figure 7 -->
                <div class="figure">
                    <img src="images/figure7.png" alt="A scatter plot examining potential correlation between hourly collisions and subway delays.">
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Investigate linear or nonlinear correlation between collision frequency and subway delay duration.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong> The data points are scattered without a distinct trend.</p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Confirms the lack of significant correlation between collisions and delays.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>Tools Used</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SQL:</strong> Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tableau:</strong> Data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Conclusion:</strong> While traffic collisions are a notable urban issue, their direct impact on subway delays 
                    appears minimal. Focusing on internal improvements—maintenance schedules, infrastructure upgrades, and better operational 
                    protocols—could significantly enhance the TTC’s reliability.

                <h3>Google Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone, I focused on <em>Cyclistic</em>, a bike-share service seeking to understand 
                    the differences in riding behavior between casual users and annual members. My goal was to identify strategies that could 
                    turn occasional riders into loyal subscribers, thereby boosting long-term revenue and user engagement.
                </p>

                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Used Excel to merge multiple CSV datasets, remove duplicates, and standardize columns like ride IDs and timestamps.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis:</strong> Calculated average ride lengths, daily/weekly usage frequencies, and seasonal user patterns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualization & Reporting:</strong> Built Tableau dashboards to illustrate differences in ride duration and frequency between user groups.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Key Findings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Longer, Leisurely Rides by Casual Riders:</strong> Average ride length for casual riders (~24.65 minutes) 
                        is almost double that of members (~12.67 minutes).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Weekend & Seasonal Surges:</strong> Casual riders show higher activity on weekends, especially during warmer months. 
                        In contrast, members maintain more consistent weekday usage, typically for commuting or errands.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Figure 1 -->

                <!-- Figure 2 -->
                <div class="figure">
                    <img src="images/figure3.png" alt="Line or bar chart displaying month-to-month changes in ride volume for casual riders vs. members.">
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Track how monthly weather changes affect ride frequency among different user types.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong> Casual rider numbers peak in summer, coinciding with warmer weather and tourism.</p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Promoting membership benefits during peak travel seasons could encourage casual riders to convert.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Figure 3 -->
                <div class="figure">
                    <img src="images/figure2.png" alt="A stacked bar chart or line graph showing ridership by day of the week for casual riders vs. members.">
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Reveal weekly usage patterns to distinguish workday vs. weekend habits.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong> Casual riders significantly spike on weekends, while members ride more evenly across weekdays.</p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Weekend promotions or loyalty programs could attract casual riders to upgrade if they see the long-term benefits of membership.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>Tools Used</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Excel:</strong> Data cleaning, preliminary exploration, and pivot tables.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tableau:</strong> Dashboard creation for ride length comparison, seasonality trends, and usage patterns.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Targeted marketing campaigns during peak leisure periods (weekends and summer months) may successfully 
                    convert more casual riders into annual members. Emphasizing membership advantages—such as discounts, priority access, or bonus ride time—could 
                    further align with the interests of casual riders, transforming their occasional use into year-round engagement.
