            <h2>Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>In this project, I analyzed Cyclistic's bike-share trip data to understand the usage patterns of annual members versus casual riders. The goal was to identify trends and provide strategic recommendations to convert casual riders into annual members, enhancing Cyclistic's profitability and growth.</p>
            
            <h3>Business Task</h3>
            <p><strong>Primary Question:</strong> How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?</p>
            
            <h3>Data Description</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Source:</strong> Cyclistic's historical trip data (past 12 months)</li>
                <li><strong>Key Variables:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trip Duration</li>
                        <li>Start Time</li>
                        <li>End Time</li>
                        <li>Start Station</li>

                        <li>Membership Type</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</li>
                <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</li>
                <li>Statistical Analysis</li>
                <li>Data Visualization</li>
                <li>Deriving Insights and Recommendations</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Casual riders tend to take longer rides compared to members.</li>
                <li>Members consistently dominate ride counts throughout the year, with a notable peak in September.</li>
                <li>Casual riders' usage peaks during summer months and weekends, indicating recreational use.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Visualizations</h3>

            <div class="figure">
                <h4>Figure 1: Average Ride Length by Membership Type</h4>
                <img src="images/figure1.png" alt="Average Ride Length by Membership Type">
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Compares the average ride lengths for two types of users: casual riders and members.</p>
                <p><strong>Observation:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Casual Riders:</strong> The average ride length is significantly longer at 24.65 minutes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Members:</strong> The average ride length is much shorter at 12.67 minutes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Casual riders likely use the service for longer, less frequent trips (possibly recreational). Members use it for shorter, frequent trips, suggesting utility for commuting.</p>
