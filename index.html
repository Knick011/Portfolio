            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi there! I'm <strong>Nihith Mekala</strong>, a data-driven storyteller with a passion for turning raw numbers into insightful narratives. 
                I am armed with SQL, Excel, and Tableau, ready to uncover patterns and paint visual pictures of complex datasets.
            </p>
            <p>
                My background is a vibrant mix of life sciences, marketing, and event management, which has taught me how to blend analytical rigor with a creative spark. Whether I’m exploring Toronto’s public transportation trends or strategizing ways to boost user engagement, I rely on data to guide decisions. 
                During my time at McMaster University, I not only honed my analytical skills, but also learned to communicate data-driven insights in a way that anyone can understand. From mentoring international students, to coordinating cultural events, and even creating a winning charity initiative, I've discovered the power of data to bring communities together, streamline operations, and inspire positive change.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond crunching numbers, I’m a multilingual enthusiast fluent in English, Telugu, and Hindi, with a basic grasp of Tamil, Japanese, and Turkish—this global perspective helps me connect with diverse teams and audiences. I love continuous learning and have dived into courses from IBM, Google, and UC Davis to stay on the cutting edge of analytics and visualization.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not analyzing data, you’ll find me brainstorming creative solutions for business challenges, guiding students as a mentor, or planning events that bring people together. For me, data isn’t just about charts and numbers; it’s about building stories, fostering understanding, and making informed decisions that help people and organizations thrive.

            <!-- Project 1: TTC Analysis -->
            <section>
                <h3>TTC Traffic Collisions and Subway Delay Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project, I explored Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) data to see if traffic collisions correlate with subway delays. Using SQL for data preparation and Tableau for visualization, I drilled down into hourly and monthly patterns to separate fact from assumption.
                </p>
                <h4>Key Findings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Traffic collisions peak during <strong>rush hours</strong> (8 AM and 5 PM), but subway delays tend to increase at <strong>6 AM and 10 PM</strong>.</li>
                    <li>No strong correlation was found between traffic collisions and subway delays, challenging the assumption that traffic directly affects subway performance.</li>
                    <li>Subway delays appear more related to internal factors like maintenance and equipment issues rather than external traffic conditions.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Visualizations & Analysis</h4>
                <div class="figure">
                    
                    <img src="images/figure4.png" alt="A line chart comparing hourly collisions and subway delays, showing distinct peak times." />
                    <p class="caption">Although collisions spike during typical rush hours, subway delays follow a different pattern, suggesting internal operation issues may be the cause of delays rather than traffic.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="figure">
                    
                    <img src="images/figure5.png" alt="A bar chart illustrating average subway delay times across different hours of the day." />
                    <p class="caption">The highest average delays occur in early morning and late evening hours, indicating potential off-peak maintenance or equipment challenges.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="figure">
                    
                    <img src="images/figure6.png" alt="A combined chart showing monthly trends of collisions and delays." />
                    <p class="caption">Monthly data reveals that fluctuations in collisions do not coincide with increases in subway delays, reinforcing the lack of a direct relationship.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="figure">
                   
                    <img src="images/figure7.png" alt="A scatter plot examining the correlation between hourly collisions and subway delays." />
                    <p class="caption">The scatter plot shows no clear correlation between collision counts and delay durations, suggesting other internal factors at play.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>Tools Used</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Excel for Data Cleaning</li>
                    <li>SQL for Data Preparation</li>
                    <li>Tableau for Data Visualization</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Subway delays are not strongly influenced by traffic collisions. By focusing on internal operational improvements, the TTC could potentially reduce delays and enhance the passenger experience.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Google Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    For this capstone project, I analyzed Cyclistic's bike-share data to understand the riding habits of casual users versus annual members. The goal was to pinpoint marketing and operational strategies to convert occasional riders into loyal subscribers.
                </p>
                <h4>Key Findings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Casual riders tend to enjoy longer, more leisurely rides, often during weekends and peak summer months.</li>
                    <li>Annual members prefer shorter, more frequent rides, spread consistently throughout the week, reflecting a more utility-driven approach.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Visualizations & Analysis</h4>
                <div class="figure">
                    
                    <img src="images/figure1.png" alt="A bar chart comparing average ride lengths between casual riders and annual members." />
                    <p class="caption">Casual riders typically spend more time per trip, suggesting a recreational use, while members hop on and off more frequently for everyday tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="figure">
                    
                    <img src="images/figure2.png" alt="A line or bar chart showing how the number of rides changes month-to-month." />
                    <p class="caption">Monthly trends highlight seasonality, with ride volumes increasing during warmer months. Casual riders especially surge during summer weekends.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="figure">
                   
                    <img src="images/figure3.png" alt="A chart breaking down rides per day of the week, comparing casual and member usage." />
                    <p class="caption">Members maintain a steady usage pattern on weekdays, while casual riders spike on weekends, indicating opportunities for targeted weekend promotions.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>Tools Used</h4>
                <ul>
                     <li>SQL for Data Preparation</li>
                    <li>Excel for Data Cleaning</li>
                    <li>Tableau for Visualization</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> By tailoring marketing initiatives to highlight membership perks—especially during weekend and holiday periods—Cyclistic can convert more casual riders into annual members and foster long-term loyalty.</p>
