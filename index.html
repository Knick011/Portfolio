                <h3>TTC Traffic Collisions and Subway Delay Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    In this analysis, I investigated whether traffic collisions in Toronto correlate with subway delays on the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) network. 
                    By cleaning and preparing data in SQL, then creating interactive visuals in Tableau, I sought to uncover any meaningful link 
                    between surface-level traffic collisions and underground subway disruptions.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Collection & Cleaning:</strong> Imported collision records and TTC delay logs, using SQL to filter out incomplete data, 
                        remove duplicates, and standardize date/time formats for accurate comparison.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Grouped collision counts by hour and month, while examining average subway delay durations 
                        during the same periods. Calculated correlation coefficients to gauge the relationship between collisions and delays.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Built interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize hourly/monthly trends and identify 
                        potential overlap between traffic collisions and subway delays.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Key Findings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Distinct Rush-Hour Patterns:</strong> Traffic collisions peaked during traditional rush hours (8 AM, 5 PM), 
                        but subway delays spiked at 6 AM and 10 PM, suggesting different driving factors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>No Strong Correlation:</strong> Monthly and hourly analyses showed minimal alignment between collision numbers and subway delays.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Operational Influences on Delays:</strong> Maintenance and equipment issues appeared more responsible for delays 
                        than external traffic conditions, particularly during off-peak hours.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <img src="images/figure4.png" alt="A line chart comparing hourly collisions and subway delays, revealing distinct peak times.">
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Illustrate and compare the frequency of traffic collisions against subway delay occurrences on an hourly basis.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Collisions peak around rush hours (8 AM and 5 PM).</li>
                            <li>Subway delays peak at 6 AM and 10 PM, outside typical rush-hour windows.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> The divergence in peak times underscores the limited influence of rush-hour collisions on subway disruptions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Additional Detail:</em> The line chart aggregates total collisions and delay counts by hour, allowing a direct visual 
                        comparison of trends throughout a 24-hour period.

                    <img src="images/figure5.png" alt="A bar chart showing average subway delay times across different hours of the day.">
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Highlight the hours with the longest average subway delay durations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Average delays are highest early in the morning (around 6 AM) and late in the evening (around 10 PM).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> 
                        Off-peak hours may be prone to longer delays due to planned maintenance, fewer staff on duty, or scheduled operational tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Additional Detail:</em> The data is aggregated by hour and averaged to reveal when commuters might experience the greatest delays, 
                        guiding resource allocation.

                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Examine whether monthly fluctuations in collision frequency mirror subway delay trends.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Months with high collision counts do not necessarily see a spike in subway delays.</li>
                            <li>Seasonal variation in traffic accidents does not translate directly to subway service disruptions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Seasonal factors affecting road safety (e.g., winter conditions) do not appear to consistently impact underground rail service.</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Additional Detail:</em> This view helps identify potential seasonal or weather-related factors. 
                        While collisions may follow certain monthly patterns, they do not align with subway performance issues over the same timeframe.

                    <p><strong>Purpose of the Visualization:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide an hourly analysis of traffic collision frequency (rectangle size) and average subway delays (color intensity).</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Rectangle Size:</strong> Represents the total number of collisions in that hour (larger rectangles = more collisions).</li>
                        <li><strong>Color Intensity:</strong> Indicates the average delay duration (in minutes) for subway services. 
                            Darker colors = longer delays.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Key Observations:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Collision Frequency (Rectangle Size):</strong> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hours like <strong>15:00</strong> (3 PM) and <strong>14:00</strong> (2 PM) stand out as larger rectangles, reflecting higher collision counts.</li>
                                <li>These timeframes align with peak traffic volume or the tail end of rush-hour congestion.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Average Delay Duration (Color Intensity):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Darker rectangles (e.g., <strong>5:00 AM</strong> and <strong>7:00 AM</strong>) signify longer subway delays, 
                                    even when collisions are relatively low at those hours.</li>
                                <li>Many high-collision hours (e.g., <strong>15:00</strong>) are lighter in color, indicating shorter delays.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Overlap of High Collisions & Long Delays:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Few hours show both large size (high collisions) and dark color (long delays), reinforcing a weak correlation between the two factors.</li>
                                <li>For example, <strong>5:00 AM</strong> has dark shading (long delays) but small size (low collision frequency), suggesting operational issues over external factors.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Off-Peak Hours:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hours such as <strong>0:00</strong> (midnight), <strong>3:00 AM</strong>, and <strong>4:00 AM</strong> show small rectangles (few collisions) and lighter shading (short delays).</li>
                                <li>This indicates minimal traffic activity and relatively efficient subway service in late-night periods.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Insights & Conclusions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Weak Correlation:</strong> The lack of overlap between large rectangles (high collision frequency) and dark colors (long subway delays) 
                            confirms that external traffic collisions are not a major driver of subway disruptions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Operational Factors Dominate:</strong> High delays in early morning or late evening hours underscore maintenance schedules, 
                            equipment checks, or staffing levels as leading causes of service interruptions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Focus on Off-Peak Interventions:</strong> The TTC could reduce delays by improving operational efficiency during hours when 
                            collisions are low but delays remain high (e.g., 5:00 AM, 10:00 PM).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h4>Tools Used</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SQL:</strong> Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tableau:</strong> Data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Conclusion:</strong> While traffic collisions are a notable urban concern, this analysis shows they have minimal direct impact on subway 
                    delays. Instead, addressing internal operational factors—such as maintenance schedules and equipment reliability—can significantly enhance TTC’s service efficiency.

                <h3>Google Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone, I focused on <em>Cyclistic</em>, a bike-share service in Chicago seeking to understand 
                    the differences in riding behavior between casual users and annual members. My goal was to identify strategies that could 
                    turn occasional riders into loyal subscribers, thereby boosting long-term revenue and user engagement.
                </p>

                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Consolidated multiple CSV files in Excel, removed duplicates, and standardized columns (e.g., ride IDs, timestamps) for consistency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis:</strong> Calculated average ride lengths, weekday/weekend usage frequencies, and monthly trends. Identified how seasonal factors influence ride volumes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualization & Reporting:</strong> Built Tableau dashboards to compare casual vs. member ride lengths, usage distribution by day of the week, and seasonal patterns.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Key Findings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Longer, Leisure-Oriented Rides for Casual Users:</strong> Average ride length is ~24.65 minutes, 
                        almost double that of members (~12.67 minutes).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Weekend & Seasonal Surges:</strong> Casual riders show higher activity on weekends, especially during warmer months, while members maintain consistent weekday usage.

                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> 
                        Seasonal promotions or incentives could capitalize on summertime interest to convert casual riders to membership plans.

                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Contrast how each user type spreads their ridership across days of the week.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Casual riders’ usage spikes on weekends, implying leisure and tourism-driven behavior.</li>

                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> 
                        Weekend-oriented promotions might appeal to casual riders, while commuter benefits and convenience features resonate with members.

                <p>
                    <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Targeted marketing campaigns during peak leisure periods (weekends and summer) could encourage casual riders to 
                    become annual members. Emphasizing membership perks—like unlimited rides, discounted rates, and priority service—would address the distinct 
                    needs of this recreational user base and potentially boost long-term retention.

                <h3>Financial Analysis: Meme Stocks vs. WMT, Gold, and USD</h3>
                <p>
                    This project compares several <strong>meme stocks</strong> (AMC, GME, MSTR) against traditional or stable assets 
                    (<strong>WMT</strong>, <strong>Gold</strong>, and the <strong>USD</strong>) from early 2020 to 2025. It demonstrates how 
                    <em>different levels of detail</em> in data visualization can dramatically affect the conclusions drawn from the same dataset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Figures 1 and 2 (labeled “Stock 1” and “Stock 2”) offer **simplistic** views with fewer details—potentially leading to misguided or incomplete insights. 
                    Figures 3 through 8 adopt a **more robust analysis**, highlighting how deeper context and clarity can yield more accurate and actionable conclusions.
                </p>

                <h4>Stock 1: Comparison of Meme Stocks and WMT</h4>
                <div class="figure">
                    <img src="images/stock1.png" alt="A simple line graph of AMC, GME, MSTR, and WMT from early 2020 to 2025.">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> 
                        A basic line chart tracking AMC, GME, MSTR, and WMT. Meme stocks show extreme volatility, while WMT remains stable.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis (High Level):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>GME spikes in early 2021 (the Reddit-driven short squeeze).</li>
                        <li>AMC also experiences a smaller meme-driven rally.</li>
                        <li>MSTR’s movement correlates with its Bitcoin holdings.</li>
                        <li>WMT is stable, reflecting a blue-chip trajectory.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Potential Pitfalls:</strong>  
                        Without **more detailed labeling or a second y-axis**, viewers might misinterpret the relative importance of these movements. 
                        **Annotations** for major events (e.g., GME short squeeze, BTC news for MSTR) are missing, further limiting context.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong>  
                        <em>Add annotated points for key events and consider a dual y-axis to handle extreme price differentials.</em>
                    </p>

                <h4>Stock 2: Average Price of Meme Stocks vs. Gold and USD</h4>
                <div class="figure">

                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> 
                        A bar chart displaying the average prices of AMC, GME, MSTR, WMT, Gold, and USD over the observed period. 
                        Gold ($1,944.59) stands out with the highest average.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis (High Level):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gold, as a safe-haven asset, holds a high price point.</li>
                        <li>Meme stocks (AMC, GME, MSTR) show higher averages than WMT due to short-lived spikes.</li>
                        <li>WMT is lower in average price but more reliable.</li>
                        <li>USD remains around $1.04, reflecting its role as a currency benchmark.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Potential Pitfalls:</strong>  
                        **Averages can be misleading** for highly volatile assets (like meme stocks). 
                        No measure of volatility (standard deviation, error bars) is shown, and returns aren't normalized.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong>  
                        <em>Consider percentage growth or returns instead of raw average prices, and add standard deviation to highlight volatility.</em>
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>GME & AMC Spikes:</strong> Sharp growth in early 2021 (meme stock rally), followed by steep declines.</li>
                        <li><strong>MSTR:</strong> Fluctuates with Bitcoin’s price, showing strong correlation with cryptocurrency markets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gold & USD:</strong> Gold maintains a moderate upward trajectory; USD remains relatively flat.</li>
                        <li><strong>WMT:</strong> Slow, steady growth, underscoring its resilience.</li>

                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>GME:</strong> Skyrockets during the short squeeze, then plummets.</li>
                        <li><strong>WMT & Gold:</strong> Show consistent growth, though less dramatic than meme stocks.</li>
                        <li><strong>AMC & MSTR:</strong> Temporary spikes but eventually underperform relative to stable assets.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong> 
                        Meme stocks can yield high returns quickly but carry significant risk of losses. 
                        Gold and WMT align with long-term, lower-volatility investment strategies.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>GME & MSTR:</strong> Outperformed WMT a significant portion of the time (87% and 83%), largely due to short-term peaks.</li>
                        <li><strong>AMC:</strong> Lower percentage than GME and MSTR, reflecting smaller rallies.</li>
                        <li><strong>WMT:</strong> Less volatile, so “underperformance” in price is offset by stability.</li>

                        <li><strong>Early 2021:</strong> GME dominates the rankings, coinciding with the retail trading surge.</li>
                        <li><strong>WMT:</strong> Typically lower in ranking but more consistent in monthly growth percentages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> AMC and GME jump around the ranks sharply, reflecting their speculative nature.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Meme Stocks:</strong> Show very low correlation with Gold, as they are driven by speculative or crypto-related news.</li>

                    <p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong>

                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> 
                        Similar to the Gold comparison, but focusing on daily movement alignment with the USD.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Meme Stocks:</strong> Display minimal alignment with USD, indicating these stocks are more speculative and less tied to currency fluctuations.</li>
                        <li><strong>WMT:</strong> Maintains a stronger alignment, driven by macroeconomic factors like consumer spending.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> 
                        Meme stock volatility is primarily fueled by retail sentiment, online communities, and crypto sentiment (for MSTR), rather than traditional economic indicators.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong> 
                        <em>Expand timeframe or compare alignment during specific market events (inflation spikes, recessionary periods) to identify if correlations change.</em>

                <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>“Bad vs. Good” Visuals:</strong> Stocks 1 & 2 are simplistic, lacking detail and context. Stocks 3–8 incorporate deeper insights, annotations, multiple axes, and more advanced metrics, illustrating how thorough analysis prevents oversimplified conclusions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk vs. Stability:</strong> Meme stocks (AMC, GME, MSTR) can yield significant but short-lived returns. WMT and Gold offer comparatively steady, long-term growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Methodology Matters:</strong> Volatility measures, correlation analyses, and temporal breakouts (monthly, daily) give a more nuanced understanding than raw averages or single-line graphs.</li>
