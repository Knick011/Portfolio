            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi there! I'm <strong>Nihith Mekala</strong>, a data-driven storyteller with a passion for turning raw numbers into insightful narratives. 
                I’m armed with SQL, Excel, and Tableau, ready to uncover patterns and paint visual pictures of complex datasets.
            </p>
            <p>
                My background is a vibrant mix of life sciences, marketing, and event management, which has taught me how to blend analytical rigor with a creative spark. Whether I’m exploring Toronto’s public transportation trends or strategizing ways to boost user engagement, I rely on data to guide decisions. 
                During my time at McMaster University, I not only honed my analytical skills, but also learned to communicate data-driven insights in a way that anyone can understand. From mentoring international students, to coordinating cultural events, and even creating a winning charity initiative, I've discovered the power of data to bring communities together, streamline operations, and inspire positive change.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond crunching numbers, I’m a multilingual enthusiast fluent in English, Telugu, and Hindi, with a basic grasp of Tamil, Japanese, and Turkish—this global perspective helps me connect with diverse teams and audiences. I love continuous learning and have dived into courses from IBM, Google, and UC Davis to stay on the cutting edge of analytics and visualization.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not analyzing data, you’ll find me brainstorming creative solutions for business challenges.

            <!-- Project 1: TTC Analysis -->
            <section>
                <h3>TTC Traffic Collisions and Subway Delay Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project, I explored Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) data to see if traffic collisions correlate with subway delays. Using SQL for data preparation and Tableau for visualization, I drilled down into hourly and monthly patterns to separate fact from assumption.
                </p>
                <h4>Key Findings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Traffic collisions peak during <strong>rush hours</strong> (8 AM and 5 PM), but subway delays tend to increase at <strong>6 AM and 10 PM</strong>.</li>
                    <li>No strong correlation was found between traffic collisions and subway delays, challenging the assumption that traffic directly affects subway performance.</li>
                    <li>Subway delays appear more related to internal factors like maintenance and equipment issues rather than external traffic conditions.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <!-- Figure 4 -->
                <div class="figure">
                    
                    <img src="images/figure4.png" alt="A line chart comparing hourly collisions and subway delays, showing distinct peak times.">
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Compare hourly collision counts with subway delay occurrences.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Collisions:</strong> Peak at 8 AM and 5 PM (rush hours).</li>
                        <li><strong>Delays:</strong> Peak at 6 AM and 10 PM, differing from collision peaks.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> The mismatch in peak times suggests delays are not directly caused by traffic collisions, implying internal operational issues.</p>

                <!-- Figure 5 -->
                <div class="figure">

                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Show the distribution of average subway delays throughout the day.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Delays:</strong> Highest in early morning (around 6 AM) and late evening (around 10 PM).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Non-peak hours see increased delays, potentially due to maintenance or operational strategies occurring outside rush hours.</p>

                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Examine if monthly changes in collisions align with changes in subway delays.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fluctuations in collisions do not mirror trends in subway delays over months.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> The lack of correlation across months supports the idea that collisions are not a main driver of subway delays.</p>

                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Visualize the correlation between collision frequency and subway delay duration on an hourly basis.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The scatter plot shows no clear relationship or trend between the two variables.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Traffic collisions are likely not a significant factor causing subway delays, directing attention to internal issues.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>Tools Used</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>SQL for Data Preparation</li>
                    <li>Tableau for Data Visualization</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Subway delays are not strongly influenced by traffic collisions. By focusing on internal operational improvements, the TTC could potentially reduce delays and enhance the passenger experience.</p>

                <h3>Google Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    For this capstone project, I analyzed Cyclistic's bike-share data to understand the riding habits of casual users versus annual members. The goal was to pinpoint marketing and operational strategies to convert occasional riders into loyal subscribers.
                </p>
                <h4>Key Findings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Casual riders tend to enjoy longer, more leisurely rides, often on weekends and during peak summer months.</li>
                    <li>Annual members prefer shorter, more frequent rides, spread consistently throughout the week, reflecting a more utility-driven approach.</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Figure 1 -->
                <div class="figure">

                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Compares the average ride lengths for two types of users: casual riders and members.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Casual Riders:</strong> Average ride length is around 24.65 minutes, longer and less frequent.</li>
                        <li><strong>Members:</strong> Average ride length is about 12.67 minutes, shorter and more frequent.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Casual riders likely use the service for leisurely, less frequent trips, while members use it for shorter, frequent trips—indicating a more utilitarian approach.</p>

                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Show seasonal trends in ride frequency throughout the year.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Higher ride volumes occur in warmer months, especially among casual riders.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Seasonal surges suggest targeted promotions during summer months could convert casual users into annual members when interest is at its peak.</p>

                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Compare weekday vs. weekend usage patterns for casual riders and members.</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Casual Riders:</strong> Spike on weekends, indicating leisure-oriented usage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Members:</strong> More consistent usage across weekdays, reflecting routine commuting.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Weekend promotions could entice casual riders to consider memberships. Consistent weekday usage by members supports their role as regular commuters.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>Tools Used</h4>
                <ul>

                    <li>Tableau for Visualization</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> By tailoring marketing initiatives to highlight membership perks—especially during weekend and holiday periods—Cyclistic can convert more casual riders into annual members and foster long-term loyalty.</p>
